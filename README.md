# üöÄ Cypress E2E API Tests

Welcome to the **Cypress E2E API Tests** repository! This project contains a collection of tests designed to ensure smooth interactions with the 
 [Conduit Academy](https://conduit.bondaracademy.com/) website and backend API. Using Cypress, we verify functionalities such as logging in, creating articles, checking response statuses, and interacting with the global feed. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## üîß Test Setup

Before running the tests, the following setup is executed:

- **Login**: A custom headless login function automatically handles logging into the application.
- **Intercept API Calls**: Intercepts the API call to the tags endpoint and replaces the response with data from a fixture (`tags.json`).
- **Intercept POST Articles**: Intercepts the POST request for creating articles and verifies both the request and response to ensure the correct data flow with data from a fixture ('articles.json').

## üß™ Tests

### ‚úîÔ∏è Verify Correct Request and Response when POSTING a new article Using the Intercept Method

This test ensures that the article creation flow works as expected:

- **Intercepts** the POST request when creating an article.
- **Submits** a new article with a title, description, body, and tags.
- **Verifies** that the request and response contain the correct data, including the status code and article details.

### üè∑Ô∏è Verify Popular Tags are Displayed 

This test ensures that the popular tags from the `tags.json` fixture are correctly displayed on the page.

- What‚Äôs tested? Popular tags like **Cypress**, **Automation**, and **Testing** should be visible on the page.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Test Like Article Display

This test checks the functionality of the "like" button on articles in the global feed using the intercept, and fixture method to update like count:

- **Verifies** that the like count is displayed correctly.
- **Ensures** that clicking the like button updates the like count.
  
> **Additional Notes**: The fixture is updated with a new like count to simulate interaction.

### üóëÔ∏è Delete a New Article in Global Feed

This test sequence demonstrates how to:

- Create an article via an API request.
- Verify its creation.
- Delete the article and confirm it is no longer visible in the global feed.

## üìÅ Test Data

- **`tags.json`**: A fixture containing a list of popular tags for testing tag display functionality.
- **`articles.json`**: A fixture containing a list of articles with like counts and other relevant details for testing article interactions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running these tests, ensure you have the following:

- **Cypress**: Ensure Cypress is installed and set up in your project.
- **API URL & Token**: Provide a valid API URL and authentication token via environment variables.
  
  Example (`cypress.json`):
  ```json
  {
    "env": {
      "apiURL": "https://your-api-url.com",
      "token": "your-auth-token"
    }
  }
  ```

> **Tip**: Don't forget to configure the authentication token for the login process!

## üîë Custom Cypress Command for Login

### üìñ Overview

The **`loginToApplication`** command automates the process of logging into the app. It sends a POST request with user credentials, stores the returned JWT token, and saves it to `localStorage` for persistent login across tests.

### üöÄ How It Works

- **User Credentials**: These are fetched securely from Cypress environment variables (e.g., `Cypress.env("username")` and `Cypress.env("password")`).
- **POST Request**: A POST request is sent to `/api/users/login` to authenticate the user.
- **Token Storage**: Upon a successful login, we store the JWT token as an alias using `cy.wrap(token).as('token')` for easy access in the other tests.
- **LocalStorage**: The JWT token is stored in `localStorage` to keep the user logged in during the test execution.

### üéØ How to Use

After adding this custom command, you can easily call `cy.loginToApplication()` in your tests to handle login automatically before each test.

Example: Add it to your `beforeEach` hook to ensure login before each test:

```javascript
beforeEach('Login to Application', () => {
  cy.loginToApplication();
});
```

This ensures every test starts with the user logged in, so you don‚Äôt have to write repetitive login code in every test case.

### ‚≠ê Benefits

- **Cleaner Code**: Abstracting the login process into a custom command makes tests cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Faster Execution**: Automating login saves time, speeding up your test execution.
- **Easy Maintenance**: If the login process changes, just update the command, and all tests will be updated automatically.
